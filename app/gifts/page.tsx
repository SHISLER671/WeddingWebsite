                  wallet that can hold and send digital money securely - like Venmo, but for the future.

                  Because we're all about embracing the future while honoring tradition! Cryptocurrency represents
                  innovation, global connectivity, and financial freedom - values we want to carry into our marriage.
                  Plus, we live on a paradise island and love trying new things. It's a fun way to introduce friends and

                  confirmation page. Click it and it'll walk you through everything step by step. You can send popular
                  cryptos like ETH (Ethereum) or stablecoins like USDC. Don't have crypto yet? The wallet can help you
                  buy some directly - no need to figure it out on your own!

                  specifically designed for crypto newbies, with built-in protections and super clear instructions.
                  You'll have full control over your transaction, and everything is transparent and traceable on the
                  blockchain. It's actually more secure than a lot of traditional payment methods!

                  We accept ETH (Ethereum) and USDC (a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar) on the Abstract network. If
                  you're new to crypto, we recommend USDC since its value stays stable at $1 per coin - makes it super
                  easy to know exactly how much you're gifting. No surprises!

                  Abstract has super low transaction fees - usually just a few cents, which is one reason we chose this

                  Of course! We love and appreciate any form of gift, and traditional cash is always wonderful. The
