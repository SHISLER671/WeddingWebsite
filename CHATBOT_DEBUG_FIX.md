# Chatbot Debug Fix - Venice AI Integration

## Problem Identified

The wedding chatbot was failing with a 404 error because the OpenRouter model `x-ai/grok-4-fast:free` is not available on OpenRouter.

**Error Details:**
\`\`\`
OpenRouter API Error: 404 - No endpoints found for x-ai/grok-4-fast:free.
\`\`\`

## Root Cause

The environment variable `OPENROUTER_MODEL` in your Vercel production environment was set to an invalid model name: `x-ai/grok-4-fast:free`.

## Solution Implemented

I've updated the code to prioritize Venice AI (free tier) and include comprehensive model validation:

### 1. Enhanced Model Validation (`lib/openrouter.ts`)
- Added validation for free tier models from [OpenRouter's free tier list](https://openrouter.ai/models?max_price=0)
- Automatic fallback to Venice AI (`cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mistral-24b-venice-edition:free`) as primary choice
- Better logging to identify configuration issues

### 2. Updated Configuration (`lib/chatbot-config.ts`)
- Same validation logic applied to chatbot configuration
- Consistent model selection across the application

## Immediate Fix Required

**You need to update your Vercel environment variables:**

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard:**
   - Navigate to: https://vercel.com/ryanshisler-gmailcoms-projects/v0-v0weddingfeb2026shislermain
   - Click "Settings" ‚Üí "Environment Variables"

2. **Update OPENROUTER_MODEL:**
   - Find the variable: `OPENROUTER_MODEL`
   - Change its value from: `x-ai/grok-4-fast:free`
   - To: `cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mistral-24b-venice-edition:free`
   - Make sure it's enabled for Production, Preview, and Development

3. **Update OPENROUTER_API_KEY:**
   - Set your new API key: `sk-or-your-actual-api-key-here`

4. **Redeploy:**
   - After updating, trigger a new deployment
   - The chatbot should work immediately

## Available OpenRouter Models

### Free Tier Models (Primary Choices):
- `cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mistral-24b-venice-edition:free` ‚≠ê (Venice AI - Uncensored)
- `mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:free`
- `mistralai/mistral-medium-3.1-24b-instruct:free`
- `meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:free`
- `meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct:free`

### Paid Models (Fallbacks):
- `openai/gpt-4o-mini` (cost-effective)
- `openai/gpt-4o` (more capable but expensive)
- `anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet` (excellent quality)
- `google/gemini-pro-1.5` (good alternative)

## What the Fix Does

1. **Model Validation:** Checks if the environment model is in the list of known working models
2. **Automatic Fallback:** Uses Venice AI (`cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mistral-24b-venice-edition:free`) as primary choice
3. **Free Tier Priority:** Prioritizes free models from [OpenRouter's free tier](https://openrouter.ai/models?max_price=0)
4. **Better Logging:** Shows which model is being used and why
5. **Prevents Future Issues:** Invalid models won't break the chatbot anymore

## Testing

After updating the environment variables and redeploying:

1. The chatbot should respond normally using Venice AI
2. Check the logs - you should see:
   \`\`\`
   ü§ñ [OpenRouter] Environment model: cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mistral-24b-venice-edition:free
   ü§ñ [OpenRouter] Selected model: cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mistral-24b-venice-edition:free
   ü§ñ [OpenRouter] Model validation: ‚úÖ Valid
   \`\`\`

## Alternative Quick Test

If you want to test immediately without waiting for Vercel deployment:

1. Remove the `OPENROUTER_MODEL` environment variable entirely
2. The code will automatically use Venice AI as the default
3. Redeploy and test

## Cost Considerations

- **Venice AI (Free Tier):** $0.00/1M tokens - Completely free! üéâ
- **Other Free Models:** Also $0.00/1M tokens
- **Fallback Paid Models:** Only used if free models fail
- Perfect for a wedding chatbot with unlimited usage

## Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Never commit real API keys to git repositories. Always use environment variables and placeholder values in documentation.

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Update Vercel environment variables with your new API key
2. ‚úÖ Redeploy application  
3. ‚úÖ Test chatbot functionality
4. ‚úÖ Monitor logs for successful responses

The chatbot should be working perfectly after these changes!
